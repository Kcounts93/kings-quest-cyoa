# The King's Quest

## Introduction

This project was not just an exercise for my brain but also a heartwarming endeavor that took me back to the roots of web development - vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The idea of this game began with a piece of paper. I wrote out the storyline, branching out the narrative based on choices. The logical flow of "if this is selected, then this happens" was then woven into code. As the project progressed, I realized the potential for optimization.

This project has been a refreshing and a light-hearted journey into the realm of game development, it also opened avenues for further enhancement and learning. I was using a switch statement which got very long and individual functions to render my scenes. It made my script file extremely long and difficult to manage. Once I completed my project I decided to clean things up a little but and incorporated a more structured approach using objects and specialized rendering functions. I also recognized the potential of this project as a perfect candidate for diving into React and practicing state management in, hopefully, a part 2 of the King's Quest.

### Looking Ahead: The King's Quest 2

The adventure doesn't end here. Envisioning "The King's Quest 2", I plan to transition this narrative into the React framework. This sequel will not only allow me to delve deeper into state management but also explore the vast capabilities of React in creating more dynamic and interactive user experiences. Stay tuned as the adventure continues, and the realm of Eldoria unfolds new mysteries and challenges.
